Tumblr plans to join the live streaming video party this week. The Yahoo-owned blogging platform added a cryptic teaser page to its website today, promising that the addition of live video will help its users "learn the metaphysical truth about your Tumblr."
The teaser, first spotted on Twitter by David Chartier, appears to be a standard Tumblr user's page, but offers various pithy promises, all of which it claims will be fulfilled tomorrow, June 21.

Besides metaphysical truths and a purported live broadcast from the surface of Mars, Tumblr's streaming video service will present more content along the lines of what you'd expect from live video, like a Harlem Globetrotter playing basketball and a Q&A with an artist from Brooklyn.
