ocial media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been banned in Algeria for a very odd reason: to prevent kids from accessing final exams that were posted online.

The sites are inaccessible there on the desktop and mobile, officials told local news agency APS, according to Reuters. Now, "tens of thousands of high school students" are retaking tests due to the leak.

Al Jazeera puts the number at 555,177 pupils, who will be retaking tests until June 22. Dozens of people were arrested earlier this month over the leak, the site says, some of whom worked "in national education offices and printers."As The Independent notes, only social media sites are blocked, so "people are still able to communicate—and potentially cheat—in private." The paper quotes an official who said the move was intended to protect kids from "phony topics."

Algeria was hit with a complete Internet blackout last month after an undersea cable was cut.
